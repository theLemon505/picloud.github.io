            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <img class="book" src="assets/book.svg">
            <p> picloud is an open-source cloud hosting provider that runs entirely on raspberry pis!
                for now it is a proof of concept but hopefully one day this site will be fully operational and have many hosting solutions
                please donate to support the project.
            </p>

        <div class="power">
            <h1>POWER</h1>
            <img class="powericon" src="assets/power.svg">
            <p1>
                though picloud runs on a weak computer, the storage is the same as any other cloud storage provider but less high maintenece and cheaper.
                picloud's webhosting is meant for websites that need to be up at all times and need a cost effective solution. picloud standard would not be able to handel lots of traffic but premium can.

            <p> 
                the security of the picloud is up to date, and effective against most threats. that does not mean that you should store super impartant files, but for any simple data, picloud is prefect for you!
